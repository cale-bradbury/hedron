# THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FORK

Feel free to use, this currently has post effects and other wip features that are yet to be integrated into the [main branch](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron). I actively perform with this branch and can confirm it's stability on windows, but features are subject to change.

# Hedron

## Getting Started

### Install
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron/releases) or
[build from source](#build-from-source).

### Load example project
1. If you haven't got the source code, download the latest example projects zip from the [releases](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron/releases) page.
2. Choose "Load Existing Project". Locate the repo directory, choose a folder and open `project.json`.
4. Play it some music, tap BPM, experiment with the controls
5. 😎

Please note that if you're trying to do this from the source code, you'll want to run `yarn` from inside the `example-projects` directory to install dependencies.

## Contributing to Hedron

If you are having fun with Hedron, we'd love you to help with development. See the repo [issues](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron/issues) for what needs doing. We're particularly looking for developers who know about:

- React/Redux
- three.js/WebGL
- Javascript performance
- Spout/Syphon/C++ ([related issue](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron/issues/21))
- Audio analysis ([related issue](https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron/issues/8))

### How to contribute

- Fork a branch from dev
- Make changes
- Make a pull request to dev

Don't worry too much if the tests aren't passing, we can work on that together. :)

### Build From Source
If you're making your own sketches, you'll probably want to build Hedron from source. You'll get lots of extra development benefits this way, such as auto refreshing on save.

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) are installed on your machine.
2. Open terminal and run the commands below.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedron.git
$ cd hedron
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

`yarn start` opens the app in dev mode, you'll probably want to close the dev tools on the right hand side of the window.

Run `yarn dist` to package up the app for best performance and no dev tools. Once the build is complete, you'll find the app inside `/dist`.

**Note for Windows users:** Hedron doesn't seem to play nice inside of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). So just install Node and Yarn natively and work like that. If you do get it working with WSL, please let us know via the issues!

### Dev scripts
| script | description |
|--|--|
| `yarn start` | Run in dev mode |
| `yarn dist` | Package the app |
| `yarn dist:dev` | Run a production build without packaging. Behaves similarly to `yarn start` in that it will look for a default project and open Chrome DevTools automatically. However it will not do any sort of live refreshing. |
| `yarn dist:example-projects`| Install dependencies for example projects, zip them and move them to the `dist` folder |
| `yarn lint` | Run linting |
| `yarn test` | Run pre deployment tests (including linting) |
| `yarn test:dev` | Run tests on file changes (does not include linting) |
